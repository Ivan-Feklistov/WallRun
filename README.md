# WallRun
Small fun project with implemented mechanics similar to Titanfall 2's wall running, wall jumping and wall climbing

Here you can see how it looks and works

Rules:
- When Player touches the wall and is in the air then he sticks to the wall and starts to slide along it if he presses movement buttons.
- No matter where Player looks, what matters is that if he moves away from the wall then wall running stops and he falls down.
- Also wall run stops if Player is on the same wall for too long (timer).
- No movement backwards allowed on the wall.
- Player can jump from the wall and keep momentum
- Player can grab the ledge if he looks at it and presses forward
